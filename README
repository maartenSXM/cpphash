-c|--cpp	keep CPP directives
-b|--blank	keep blank lines
-o|--outdir	output dir ("-o -" for stdout)
-C|--clean	clean output dir
-v|--verbose	verbose mode
-h|--help	help

dehash stores dehashed files in ./.dehash.  It can output them to stdout using flag: -o -

dehash was originally written to remove hash-style comments in files that require
the C-preprocessor for macro features.  Use the -c option to leave CPP directives
in the dehash-ed files.
