dehash removes '#'-style comments from one file on the command line
and writes the output to stdout.  If no file is specified, dehash
reads from stdin.

arguments are:
-c|--cpp	keep CPP directives
-b|--blank	keep blank lines
-h|--help	help

dehash was originally written to remove hash-style comments in files
that require the C-preprocessor for macro features.  Use the -c option
to leave CPP directives in the dehash-ed files.  That option is specified
by ./cpptext.sh, which can dehash multiple files at a time since one
might need to include another dehash-ed file.

Some possible dehash command variants are:
 ./dehash.sh -h
 ./dehash.sh  example.txt
 ./dehash.sh -b example.txt
 ./dehash.sh -c -b example.txt
